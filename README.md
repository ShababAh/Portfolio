# Portfolio
I created my personal portfolio website to showcase my profile, including my experience, skills, and projects. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend and APIs are developed in Java (J2EE). MySQL is used as the database to manage all the data efficiently.
